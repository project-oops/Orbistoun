//! Walking a submitted command buffer into packets.
//!
//! # What a submission actually is
//!
//! When a guest calls the submit function it hands over a buffer of dwords addressed
//! to the GPU's command processor. That buffer is a packet stream: each packet has a
//! header saying what kind it is and how many dwords follow, so the stream can be
//! walked without understanding a single command.
//!
//! Walking it is the entire first step of GPU work, and it is worth doing long before
//! anything is translated. A submission decoded into "set these registers, bind that,
//! draw N times" is the difference between an opaque blob and a work list.
//!
//! # The same discipline as everywhere else
//!
//! Unknown packet types are **counted and reported**, never skipped. A walk that
//! desynchronises says so. A packet claiming to extend past the end of the buffer is
//! a strong signal that a length rule is wrong, and is reported rather than followed
//! into whatever memory happens to sit after the buffer.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! The packet format is public: AMD documents it, and the open-source Linux driver
//! and Mesa parse these exact structures. Hardware documentation from the chip
//! vendor, not console firmware.
//!
//! **The values below are transcribed and not yet verified line by line against the
//! published document.** Same caveat as the shader encoding table, and the same
//! mitigation: a walk over a real command buffer that desynchronises immediately is
//! how a mistake here announces itself.
